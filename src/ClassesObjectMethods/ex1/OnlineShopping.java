/*Create a new Java project and try modeling a domain youâ€™re comfortable with. It could be
        something like: Sports, Business, Mathematics, Online Shopping, etc. For example, if you
        modeled online shopping, you might create classes to represent: Customer, Product, Order,
        etc. These classes would likely have properties and you may think of a few methods that
        might make sense for them too. There is no example code for this
